## Major Contributions
The major contributions of the paper include:
- **Development of the Inception architecture**: A novel deep neural network architecture that balances depth and width to optimize computational efficiency.
- **Hebbian principle and multi-scale processing**: The architectural decisions were informed by these principles to enhance the network's performance.
- **GoogLeNet implementation**: A 22-layer deep network that significantly outperforms previous models on the ILSVRC 2014 classification and detection tasks.
- **Efficiency considerations**: The network design emphasizes computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-world applications with limited computational resources.
