# [ResNet]

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of ResNet. Below you will find detailed information and resources related to this architecture.

## Detailed Explanation
For a comprehensive understanding of the paper and its contributions, please refer to the [detailed blog post](https://gvdmnni.notion.site/ResNet-f34ba2f4ad474fbdbda365b881f8b1cc?pvs=4).

## Major Contributions
The major contributions of the paper include:
- Introduction of the residual learning framework for training very deep neural networks.
- Demonstration that degradation of training accuracy in very deep networks is addressed by residual learning.
- Comprehensive empirical evidence showing that residual networks are easier to optimize and can gain accuracy from substantially increased depth.
- State-of-the-art results on ImageNet classification, with architectures exceeding 100 layers.
- Generalization of the residual learning concept to object detection tasks.
