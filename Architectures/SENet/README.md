## Major Contributions
The major contributions of the paper include:
1. Introduction of the Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) block, a lightweight yet effective module for modeling channel-wise relationships in CNN features.
2. Development of the SENet architecture, which can be created by stacking multiple SE blocks.
3. Demonstration of significant performance improvements when integrating SE blocks into existing state-of-the-art architectures like ResNet, Inception, and MobileNet.
4. Extensive experimentation showing the effectiveness of SENets across various datasets and tasks, including image classification, scene classification, and object detection.
5. Winning the ILSVRC 2017 classification competition, showcasing the practical impact of the proposed method.
