## Getting Started

Each directory contains the implementation of a specific architecture along with training scripts and detailed documentation. To get started with any architecture, navigate to the respective directory and follow the instructions in the README file.

### Installation

Each architecture has its own set of dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file in its directory. You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit issues or pull requests to help improve the implementations and documentation.

### Contact
For any questions, please open an issue or contact the repository maintainer.
